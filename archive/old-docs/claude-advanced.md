# ðŸš€ Advanced Claude Code Usage Patterns

## Quick Reference Commands

### 1. Complex Refactoring
```bash
# Extract and modularize code
claude code . << 'EOF'
Analyze all game files and:
1. Extract common patterns into utils/
2. Create base classes for games
3. Implement dependency injection
4. Add comprehensive error handling
EOF
```

### 2. AI-Driven Features
```bash
# Add smart features
claude code --task "Add AI opponent to Super Pong that learns from player patterns"

# Procedural generation
claude code --task "Create level generator for Castle Siege using Wave Function Collapse"
```

### 3. Performance & Optimization
```bash
# Full performance audit
claude code --task "Run performance audit on all games and implement:
- Lazy loading for game assets
- Web Workers for physics calculations  
- GPU acceleration for particle effects
- Memory leak detection"
```

### 4. Testing & Quality
```bash
# Comprehensive testing
claude code --task "Set up testing framework:
- Unit tests for game logic
- Visual regression tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Multiplayer integration tests"
```

### 5. Architecture Patterns
```bash
# Event-driven architecture
claude code --task "Implement event system:
- Custom event dispatcher
- Game state management
- Undo/redo functionality
- Save/load game states"
```
