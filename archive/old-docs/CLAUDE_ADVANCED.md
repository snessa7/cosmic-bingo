```

## 2. Code Analysis & Refactoring
```bash
# Deep code analysis
claude code --task "Analyze codebase for:
- Code duplication
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Accessibility issues
Then create a refactoring plan"

# Pattern extraction
claude code --task "Extract recurring patterns and create reusable modules"
```

## 3. Smart Feature Implementation
```bash
# AI-powered features
claude code --task "Add adaptive difficulty that adjusts based on player skill"

# Advanced animations
claude code --task "Implement smooth transitions between games using FLIP technique"
```

## 4. Architecture Transformation
```bash
# Convert to modern architecture
claude code --task "Transform games to use:
- ES6 modules
- State management pattern
- Component-based structure
- Event-driven communication"
```

## 5. Debugging & Optimization
```bash
# Interactive debugging
claude code --debug << 'ISSUE'
